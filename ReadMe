Execute Trevisan's extractor with the following arguments:
-n [input length (in bits)]
-m [output length (in bits)]
-i [input file]
-a [min-entropy rate of the input file]
-e [eps: error tolerance, the distance between extracted output distribution and uniform distribution]
-o [output file]
-v (either or not display verbose information of the parameters)

* the seed file should be given as "seed" in the same directory.
** in case the input file or seed file is larger than the necessary size, the program operates only on the beginning and ignores the unnecessary part.
*** for some combination of parameters, the extractor cannot work because of the underlying implementation does not support algebra over fields of size greater than 2^{64}.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Here is an example of how to invoke the extractor and extract 10k bits (and save to extracted_sample) from 1M bits (stored in the file input_sample) with min-entropy 0.5M bits and error tolerance 0.001. 

./tre_ext -n 1000000 -m 10000 -i input_sample -a 0.5 -e 0.001 -o extracted_sample -v



The execution outputs the following on screen, which means the running time is 24.9 seconds and uses 16384 bits from the seed.
